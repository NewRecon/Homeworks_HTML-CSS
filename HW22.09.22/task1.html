	<h3 style="color:#708090; font-family:Arial">PROLOGUE</h3>

	<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:18px; color:#2c2c2c">
		Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
		In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
		From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
		Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
		From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
		A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
		Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
		Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
		The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
		And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
		Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
		Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
		The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
		What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.<br>

	<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:18px; color:#2c2c2c">No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
